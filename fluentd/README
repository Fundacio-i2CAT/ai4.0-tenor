Two new no-core modules are used for fluentd

'fluent-plugin-out-http'
This module is used to send a received log message as an http post to a backlog point.

'fluent-plugin-grep'
This module is used to parse the log and add extra tags, for better parsing.

Install them using their gemfiles by running 'bundle install' in the tenor initial directory.
